2. Get total numbers of paths from source to destination in a directed graph?
3. Find the next bigger number using the same set of digits?
4. Find the longest palindromic subsequence?
5. How to reverse a string without using any extra space?
6. Find the maximum sum in longest increasing subsequence?
7. Find whether the path exists between 2 nodes in a directed graph?
8. Find the length of the largest region of 1’s in a binary matrix. 1’s connected vertically, diagonally and horizontally in the matrix is called region.
9. Find the shortest distance from a source vertex to all vertices \(Dijsktra’s algorithm\)?
